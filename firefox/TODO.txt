Need to figure out secure and private configuration for Firefox and update firefox.cfg accordingly.

Please Mozilla, don't touch the user.js functionality in Firefox

    The arkenfox user.js is a template which aims to provide as much privacy and enhanced security 
    as possible, and to reduce tracking and fingerprinting as much as possible - while minimizing 
    any loss of functionality and breakage (but it will happen).
